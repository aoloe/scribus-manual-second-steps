# Notes

- the palettes in the window menu
- the managers in the edit and page menus
- the properties palette
- navigating the document
  - zoom
  - changing page
- raster and vector images
- master pages, guides and the scrapbook
- page size, margins and bleeds
- embedding and outlining fonts in a PDF
- imposition
- add a text frame and write
- add an image frame and load an image (external)
- italic and bold (with an explanation of the matching terms... slanted, ... "bold" means "gras"...)
- don't print, make a pdf and print it
- pages: scribus does not dynamically add the pages
  - define the number of pages at document creation (for shorter brochures)
  - adding the pages from the `page > insert` menu.
  - facing pages: defined in the `file > new` dialog or in `file > document settings`; first left / right
  - page numbers: add from menu into a text frame on the master page. (adding pages numbers / running headers would be a good tutorial for working with master pages / scrapbook / ...)
- don't print: create a pdf and then print it.
